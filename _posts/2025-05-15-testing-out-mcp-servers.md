title: "Testing out MCP Servers"
---

I spent some time the other day putting together two MCP servers--one that gets Sentry issues and another that gets GitHub issues. Both have been very useful when working with Claude Code. I can just issue a prompt like "Fix http://subdomain.sentry.io...", and away it goes. It speeds up big fixing significantly!
