    <p>Recently our family had the opportunity to visit Washington.  DjangoCon 2014 was held in Portland, Oregon, and my boss gave the go-ahead for me to attend it. We also got clearance from our daughter's pulmonary-hypertension doctor to go.  So, August 29th came, and away we went... on the road!</p>
<p>We left Cedar City at around 1:30pm, stopped in Parawon to see the county-fair exhibits (pictures) we all submitted, and arrived at a Boise hotel around 11pm. The next morning, after eating a quick continental breakfast (with Kathy and I both eating half-warm, half-cold beef-and-bean burritos, which we had mistakenly thought were breakfast burritos; nasty, nasty!), we headed for Seattle.</p>
<p>The kids did absolutely great on the road.  We only made a few stops, including one in Pendleton, Oregon for lunch and a visit to a park (next to the Pendleton Roundup stadium). About an hour east of Seattle, driving on I-90, we hit the tail-end of a storm. It was a gorgeous stretch of drive! The clouds were low on the mountains, the freeway bent around the several curves of green hills, and the rain hit the windshield. It made me miss the Great Northwest!</p>
<p>We finally arrived at my sister's place at around 5:30. They fed us pizza, and we went to the shore of Lake Washington for a walk. The kids really enjoyed throwing rocks into the lake and eating blackberries, and I loved talking with my sister and brother-in-law whom I only see about once a year.</p>
<p>The next morning, we went on a nature walk in the Union Bay Nature Area, and ate some more blackberries, and enjoyed each other's company.  After that, we went to Church with them and heard some really good talks!  Then we went back to my sister's place for some delicious french-dip sandwiches, and then we drove down to Ridgefield, Washington where my parents live.</p>
<p>We arrived after 10pm, got settled in, and the next morning I headed out to DjangoCon. I'll blog about that later.</p>
<p>We stayed around the house for the first few evenings, but on Thursday evening, my family picked me up in Portland, and we went to Jamison Park to let the kids splash around in the water.  I love watching their excitement!  The find such wonder in the little joys of life.</p>
<p>Then we went to perhaps the most successful dinner we've had with the kids ever! We went to Yummy Mongolian Grill in Vancouver, WA.  We were able to get a table outside, and were by ourselves for most of the time.  The kids all dished up what they wanted to eat, and ate amazingly. Our five-year-old ate a lot of squid... and loved it.</p>
<p>Saturday evening, we went to a wedding reception of a friend of the family.  It was great to see them!  Then Sunday came, we thought we lost our three-year-old for a bit after Church was over, and we spent a lot of time around the house. I loved going outside with my Mom to pick some prunes for her trip to Alaska the next day.</p>
<p>The next day came, my parents had left before we awoke, we packed, cleaned, and headed out.  We made more stops on the way back than the way there, but we finally arrived back in Cedar Tuesday evening (Sep 9th).</p>
<p>It was a wonderful trip, it was awesome to be with my family and attend the conference, and now I am buried at work and with life in general. But life is good.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing, we listened to Jim Gill's <a href="http://store.jimgill.com/cd3.html">Do Re Mi on his Toe Leg Knee</a> album probably about twenty times! It's our kids new favorite.</p>
